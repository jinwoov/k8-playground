Deploying {{ .Chart.Name }} in your cluster

If you are trying this out locally you would need to define secret within your cluster

Please inject environment variable with PSQL with username and password

Follow this format:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: psql-settings
      namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
    data:
      SONAR_JDBC_USERNAME: base64 value of PSQL username
      SONAR_JDBC_PASSWORD: base64 value of PSQL password
